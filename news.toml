Title = "Redux Update: Modding tools - Unity Editor"
Content = "Recently efforts have been made in the \"modding support\" side of Redux, today I want to share with you a breakthrough that will make modding the game a much smoother process.\n\nUsing Redux's modding SDK, which will be partly based on the KSP2 Unity Tools package, in conjunction with PassivePicasso's ThunderKit you will be able to test your mods by running KSP2 Redux directly in the Unity editor!\n\nThis allows you to:\n- Very quickly iterate, with changes being able to be tested in a matter of seconds, not minutes.\n- View what's happening in-game in real time using the Scene view.\n- Access the full suite of Unity Editor tools, including for example custom inspectors for Unity and KSP2 components.\n- Use built-in Unity C# debugging tools and any other Unity package library.\n\nOn a technical note, we are still figuring out stuff like Harmony which does not really work in the editor (but will work fine in the compiled mods), we'll keep you updated if we make progress on this front. For simplicity, we will also want the modding API to provide as many endpoints as possible that allow you to mod the game without the use of Harmony."

Title = "Tech Tree Features"
Content = "One of the new features that will be introduced in the initial release of Redux are new tech tree requirements. Tech tree nodes now can have multiple new requirements that have to be met before the node can be researched: **missions** and **science experiments**.\n\nIn the showcase video, you can see that the nodes with these extra unlock requirements are marked with a small lock icon in the bottom right corner, and when you select them, you will see the requirements listed in the details panel on the left.\n\nOnce all the requirements of such a node are met, you will receive a notification that the node is now available for research, and you can proceed to unlock it as usual (that is, if you have enough science points).\n\n*Note that the video is only illustrative and the actual nodes with special requirements will be different in the release. Currently, we are planning to have missions gating the progress between the tech tree tiers.*"
